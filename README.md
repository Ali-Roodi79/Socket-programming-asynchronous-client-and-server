This project was one of my university projects in the advanced programming course in the second semester of the university. This program includes two parts, the client and the server, To send text messages asynchronously, which are implemented using socket programming in C#. !!! Both the client and the server must run simultaneously The procedure is that you send a message to the server and the server sends the same message back to you.
